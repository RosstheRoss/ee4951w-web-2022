An complete rewrite of the web application for Professor Andrew Lamperski's Remotely Accessible Inverted Pendulum, in TypeScript.

## TODO

- Feature parity with the original web application.
  - This includes running the python scripts like the Flask app did.
- Login with the University's Shibboleth system.
- Add the livestreaming feature.
- **Improve the readme.**
